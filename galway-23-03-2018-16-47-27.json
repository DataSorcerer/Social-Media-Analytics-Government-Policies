That being said, don't bring an umbrella when you're crossing the Quincentennial. It won't survive the trip.\n\nMake friends with the natives. We're standoffish and very sarcastic to begin with but you will have a much better time and will get more out of the experience than if you surround yourself with Americans. I assume it's NUIG you're going to; the Rover Soc there is right up your alley, they organise lots of hikes.\n\nIf your last Irish ancestor came over during the Famine, don't call yourself Irish. You are Irish-American. \n\nWe don't have iced coffee, pumpkin spice, canned pumpkin, or canned chicken. A lot of American staples aren't available here. We do have Boojum and Dough Bros though! Pro tip, get the burrito bowl in Boojum, there's more in it.\n\nDon't rely on Galway's bus system. Walk, or get a taxi.\n\nTravel! Try to go somewhere every weekend, in Ireland or in Europe. Ryanair is perfectly safe and dirt cheap. \n\nIf your college has arranged accommodation for you, you're probably in Gort na Coiribe. Tesco and Dunnes are very close, but Aldi and Lidl are about a ten minute walk and they're way cheaper.\n\nGalway has a great pub scene. The Skeff, Busker Brownes and the Front Door are very popular with students. There's music somewhere every night. I know for certain NUIG's Trad Soc has sessions on Tuesday nights in the Crane Bar. The Roisin Dubh has indie gigs fairly frequently. The most popular nightclubs are Electric, FourFour, Carbon and DNA, but you're far better off in the pubs imo. Whatever you do, don't go to Coyotes. It's not worth it. Believe me.\n\nFinally, be nice to your housemates. Be friendly, but give them some space too. Ask permission if you're bringing someone to visit, even if your housemates won't be there. Try to help with cleaning. Don't complain about how tough your course is, especially if your housemates are in third or fourth year; they purposely make the courses for visiting students easy so you won't fail.

We're a coastal city, seafood is great here too.\n\nRegarding nightlife, Sunday to Thursday are when the students are out (especially Thursday), Saturday is when everybody else is out. Try a mix of both! Don't just stick to the same couple of pubs, wander into any old place that catches your eye, just don't be a stereotypical loud tourist. That is, do as the locals do.\n\nAs others have said, travel more if you can. It's a two hour flight from Dublin to Prague, an hour to London, Edinburgh, etc. Europe is on our doorstep, take advantage.\n\nThere's no need to tell us how things are different back home, we already know.\n\nOwn a good raincoat, expect to need it most days.\n\nPenneys is your friend for cheap winter clothes.", "Start looking for accommodation now.

Galway is quite small so far as cities go, so be sure to go explore other areas. You can get the train to cork through limerick junction for like 40 euro round trip.

And check out franciscan well for the best craft beer in the country.\n\nYou also shouldn't tie yourself to Ireland, as its super cheap to fly around the EU on ryanair. If you get a few friends together you can spend a long weekend in rome for 200 each (flights included), or spend a night in london or Edinburgh for like 70 euro each (again, flights included). \n\nGet yourself some Irish friends to show you the ropes and teach you the dos and donts.

The authentic Irish culture is quite different from the variant you\u2019ll be used to in America; it\u2019s much less explicit and visible.

I don\u2019t want to sound precious, but it\u2019s likely something that you\u2019ll have to imbibe gradually, without forcing it. I\u2019ll be studying in Germany at the same time you\u2019re here in Ireland, and my plan is not to try to vampire-suck them for their culture, but instead to make friends like I would back home and be as much a curiosity to them as they are to me. \n\n+1 for what someone said about taking regular trips and using Ireland as a base for travelling to Europe.

Another downside of Galway is that it has been very badly developed in the last 40 years and it's very difficult to get around by public transport or by car. You could use a bike, but the roads are quite hostile for cyclists and the weather is poor at the best of times. If you can afford to live in or near the city centre or in Salthill (which is beside the sea but near the city centre), that's your best bet.

It has the highest ratio of student to locals of any place in Ireland which keeps the city young and active. The city has created an economy built on the students in term time, tourists in the summer and a little tech/medical industry. The pubs are truly amazing, the city full of charm and history and the people are generally fun, open minded and creative. Everybody has the potential to be a playwright, busker or storyteller. The art and drama scene has been punching above its weight for 40 years. The arts festival in summer is great. The music scene attracts better gigs than a little city should.  \n\nPubs: Have pints with artists and poets in Neachtains, check out gigs in the Roisin Dubh and stay for a session of traditional music in the Crane. Explore the other pubs, the best nights are often spontaneous and off the beaten path. Don't spend every weekend in The Front Door/Supermacs, but check them out too. You might some scummy bastards, especially when drink has been taken and pubs are closing, but they generally don't mean too much harm. Clear the head and go for long walks down the Long Walk, the South Park and out to Salthill. Take a bus tour to the cliffs of Moher and around Connemara. Make a friend with a local and go visit their mammy in the country. The food scene is just taking off but there is starting to be some great restaurants, particularly over the west end of the city. Craft beer has also arrived and worth exploring too. \n\nThe worst parts are the weather and housing - Most days will be wet, grey and windy. Get over it. It's just the way it is. Don't be another moaning foreigner (the city has a surprisingly large population of Spanish and Brazilian students who eventually succumb to a large case of S.A.D. 12 months a year.) But when the sky is blue drop everything, go out and rejoice. As the saying goes, make hay when the sun shines. Galway glistens in the sun. And if you don't like the weather, just wait 15 minutes. It all passes. \n\nThe housing is harder to conquer as everything in the centre is over-priced and often a really shitty standard. This is a national problem as there has been such poor planning and investment in building and maintaining places to rent. You might be lucky, but be prepared for some crap apartments and house shares. \n\n Overall, it's a small town at the end of the day, but there's a great buzz and when the sun shines take a bottle of wine/buckfast and head down to the The Spanish Arch and enjoy life at it's best. \n\nBig tip: Join some of the NUIG clubs and societies, it's a great way to meet people who are interested in things you like and are open to making new friendships.

If X is 10,000 people, it'll be 1,000 people.

Running on the big assumption that the population doesn't meet the critical mass to sustain the rail, do we increase ticket prices?

Both villages are little more than hamlets really, and offer no accommodation outside of local B&B's. Bullaun lies only a few minutes drive from Loughrea, however, which has a [pretty good hotel](https://www.loughreahotelandspa.com/spa.html) (or so I've been told - being reasonably local means I've never actually stayed there).  \n\nBullaun is also by now the larger of the two halves, and the church there is now the seat of the Parish Priest, but this was not always so. New Inn used to be the larger, and (I know from experience) there was where the records of births and deaths used to be kept. You will need to ask Father Kenny (the PP, who now lives in Bullaun and maybe the records came with him) to view them. Much work has been done in recent years to digitise these old records (speaking generally), so be sure to search online resources to see if what you want is there. You'll want to check County Council records as well as various digitisation projects. The National Library of Ireland apparently (source: my mother) has a lot of microfilmed records as well.\n\nWith two villages, there are two churches to service them and consequently two churchyards with graves. Note, however, that there are two further graveyards (for Catholics), and there used to be a chapel (with, presumably, attendant graves) for a small Protestant community in Woodlawn - the local train station. The two graveyards are in [Killaan](https://www.google.ie/maps/@53.3206098,-8.4633382,3a,75y,355.47h,77.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sWx0TDJKqOvTMgl9AtfAcRw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) and [Grange](https://www.google.ie/maps/@53.2992407,-8.5152885,3a,75y,79.32h,90t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sQR3WapaUOyPT4zIsqPyqCA!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo0.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DQR3WapaUOyPT4zIsqPyqCA%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D72.49224%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656).

", "I was wondering why the fuck they removed the roundabout from the G Hotel/Huntsman junction... What a fucking joke. Traffic lights are always less efficient, with the second for every fucking asshole to wake up and get moving when the green light comes on.", "There is a bypass planned, it was supposed to have amstartwd years ago, but they have the final plans in and it\u2019s supposed to go from Barna over to Bushypark and over Menlo at Bushypark. It will be great for people coming from the east side over to the wesside, but as you point out, doesn\u2019t really do much for the main problem areas. Galway corpo and coco just know they need a bypass, so they\u2019re putting down a bypass. It seems particularly badly planned to my eyes, but it will be another crossing over the river. How people will filter back from Bushypark seems absurd to me, they\u2019ll be backing up newscastle traffic and, ironically, the bridge. The other option is to go by Westside via the Westwood, which is also goign to back up existing traffic and inevitably, back up traffic on the bridge again! This then feeds on to east side traffic.\n\nThis is the exact problem with Galway. If a few things happen in Renmore, it effects the traffic in Westside and vice versa!\n\nAnyway, Arup are the engineers for the project and it\u2019s gotten the go ahead. When is another question, but I think they\u2019ve preliminary fucked it up again before it has even been built. The only solution is to build the same bypass but have different access points, which requires more of a turn at Bushypark, and also the addition of another feeder road to Bushypark/Westside. This might mean completely renovating the Letteragh Road. Everyone from knocknacarra uses it and it\u2019s textbook third class windy road. Or another road transversing the same section where the bypass is due to go, but for local traffic. Otherwise, predictable bottlenecks and future shit traffic!!", "You have to drive in Galway because the weather is so bad.", "Then who are all these cunts in their cars!!!", "The majority of people working in the city don't live there, they drive in and out. Galway is fucking terribly laid out and that won't change without it being burned to the ground and rebuilt from scratch. ", "They seem to grandstand enuf about lawds drinks cans down at the Spanish arch tho. But can't seem to put together a cohesive solution to the traffic situation. ", "Ah man in fairness that is bollocks. There was one bus to Parkmore yesterday between 3 and 430 there was well over 100 ppl waiting by the time is got there which is fairly ridiculous  ", "Aye that bypass has been in the works for the last 20 yrs, and has endured hold up after hold up, I think bog cotton or butterflies stopped it at one point, so don't hold your breath for it. And even if it does, starting at Barna is way too close to the city, it doesn't leave much room for further expansion, if not for Barna woods the the sprawl would have continued west. Barna itself is rapidly expanding with plenty of sites with planning permission for estates. \n\nHadn't heard about the Bish thing, sounds like an absolute future nightmare.", "Well, yeah. The source is me. I\u2019m a civil engineer and I did grad work with the council before I went to the UK and my brother in law works for the company that did all the road works. We discussed in detail how shit an idea it was and how terrible and unqualified the director of services was. Brother in law hopes they figure out their mistake in another 10 years so he could get the tender to fix it again on useless roadworks.", "That particular roundabout was always shit, but it was the worst of both worlds. Traffic lights and a roundabout and every second red light didn\u2019t count. Was very confusing. But in solving that one junction, they screwed up all the other ones. \n\nTransport is definitely  another problemet. But then the new road upgrades created many bus lanes with no buses. So, yeah, Galway has little to no public transport. \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t explain why a small city with so many circulatory routes has such bad traffic. Bohermore roundabout is way too small, could easily have been rectified 10 years ago, but it wasn\u2019t. Also, there was never that much of a build up in traffic when there was a roundabout at M\u00f3in\u00edn na gCiseach. Most of the traffic build up in Galway is source build up. This source is the traffic lights. ", "That one and the one at Briarhill are definitely the ones affected the most. They worked absolutely perfectly as roundabouts! ", "They may have to look at limiting Construction on the west of the city in future. The more that\u2019s built on that side the more infrastructure will be needed to cater for them. It\u2019s been bad enough getting this road off the ground it\u2019ll be impossible once the university continue to build along the river.", "Are you one of them?", "Like 2/3 people working in Galway commute there, most by car. The people living in Galway are not that representative of those working in Galway, although my experience is that everyone with a car in Galway drives, even if they're only traveling what would be a 10 minute walk. In fairness the weather is always shit so it's no wonder such habits form. ", "I was just making a Futurama joke. I know zero about Galway traffic.", "Cos they\u2019re not even trying. What we have now is the solution. ", "Yeah, and a new breed of snails at one point! Those are the reasons that\u2019s it\u2019s so close to the city. I mean, Barna is one thing, but Bushypark is right at the city. Very silly placement alright, if it ever bloody well he\u2019s built.", "Jesus", "I think it's sheer volume and not traffic lights. That Bohermore roundabout is a joke, no idea why it's still there. Massive problem too is that there are thousands of people living on one side of the city and working on the other. ", "Fucking madness, that always bothered me at the time (and I was only in Galway occasionally) **\u0ca0_\u0ca0**", "All the land the university owns is beside the river and connected to the university by the river, so it shouldn\u2019t affect traffic too much. The bits that it does should be catered for.\n\nThe solution wouldn\u2019t be to stop construction but to build infrastructure with the construction. This is how the Western Distributor Road was built, each housing estate had to build a part of the road. Perfectly doable, it\u2019s sinpky that Galway Corpo and CoCo are completely shit and the directors of services are not qualified... in anything. They\u2019re textbook baby boomer clerical workers who were opportunistically promoted when the city engineer position was abolished. Since then, nothing gets done.\n\nGalway doesn\u2019t have planning. Galway planning is atrocious. A 5 year old could plan better.\n\nThe problem with Galway is planning! Simple as. Or lack thereof! The planners aren\u2019t planners. They\u2019re jobforlife people.", "Sadly no ", "It's really really fucking shit, literally all the time. Now you know. ", "It\u2019s not just the sheer volume, although of course that effects it too. It\u2019s literally crap planning. The volume isn\u2019t that high compared to the actual size of the city and there are plenty of arterial horoughfares, most of which I would choose to use myself. Most of the problem is flow.\n\nThey\u2019ve increased this problem by opening the new Tuam-Ennis motorway with a badly planned exit onto Briarhill, an area already suffering from over saturation and bottle necking. It\u2019s all these things that make traffic in Galway absolutely shit. \n\nCompare it to Salthill where traffic is never bad.. reason being there are a multitude of well planned roads that feed into each other and allow for circulation. Western Distributor Road is a good example of a modern road that should work well but doesn\u2019t because go the clusterfuck of lights leading down into Westside. It\u2019s all fine on the Salthill side, even with all the schools and people constantly goign to and parking on the prom.\n\nSalthill is simply well laid out as it was planned properly in the fifties, when Dalysfort, Grattan, Rockbarten etc was built.", "In terms of the university I was thinking more if they ever want to build another bridge it\u2019ll be in the way.", "The bridge is going over Dangan, just short of the university\u2019s land. They wouldn\u2019t build a bypass that close to the city, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s just short of Dangan. They still haven\u2019t resolved any of the current traffic issues so I foresee new traffic problems with this bypass, not just local but affecting the whole city via the back up created from the new bypass, which will effect the existing bridge again! \n\nGalway just can\u2019t and won\u2019t fucking plan anything!"]}, {"id": "7f6kuf", "title": "Wolfing around near Galway", "url": "https://i.redd.it/4z9mzhwaewzz.jpg", "score": 135, "created_utc": 1511518265.0, "num_comments": 24, "comments": ["Good thing you werent 'Dogging around Galway'", "what the fuck is that thing? it does look like a wolf, is it some sort of wolf shepard cross?", "That's a beautiful looking dog, What's her name?
